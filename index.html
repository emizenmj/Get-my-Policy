                        <p>Illness and accidents are the most unwanted settlements of life that completely drain your savings. Health insurance provides financial coverage to you against medical expenses incurred due to an accident, minor injury, illness, or critical disease. </p>
                        <p>Get My Policy covers a wide range of care health insurance policies certified under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Obama Care is the unofficial name for The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that was signed into law on March 23, 2010 by President Barack Obama. The primary objective of health care reform is to provide healthcare coverage for all (currently uninsured) Americans universally and to decrease the costs of health care services and coverage.</p>

                        <p>It is a fact that health is wealth. But you can’t prove it if you are not taking proper care of it. Today’s sedentary lifestyle becoming a major health concern. While the overall life expectancy has increased significantly, it is also a fact that the number of diseases that affect health is also on a rise.</p>
                        <p>In that regard, there is no denying the fact that health insurance plans are a necessity, regardless of your age. With medical inflation, a lot of people turn towards family health insurance to avoid having to pay huge medical bills that can wipe out their entire savings.</p>

                        <p>In a way, health insurance is a lot like car insurance. But, unlike car insurance, health insurance covers far more than just the costs of a bad accident. Health insurance often covers things like annual checkups, vaccinations, preventive health, and other “routine maintenance” for your body and mind. It’s as if car insurance helped pay for oil changes and tire rotations. Therefore it is wise to do planning for your affordable health insurance in advance.</p>
